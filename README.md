<p>This notebook contains a comprehensive set of Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks designed for learners interested in bioinformatics, specifically focusing on analyzing and visualizing Protein Data Bank (PDB) and mmCIF files. Here's an overview of what learners can expect to learn from the code:</p>
<div>
    <h2>1. File Management and Data Preparation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Create directories and manage files for PDB and mmCIF data.</li>
        <li>Download PDB and mmCIF files using Python.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>2. PDB File Analysis</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Open and read `.ent` and `.pdb` files to extract useful information.</li>
        <li>Extract metadata such as ligands, chains, resolution, and organism details.</li>
        <li>Filter and clean data by removing empty or irrelevant values.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>3. mmCIF File Analysis</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Parse mmCIF files into Python dictionaries using `MMCIF2Dict`.</li>
        <li>Extract specific details like protein sequences, ligands, and molecular weights.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>4. Protein Sequence Analysis</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Extract and process protein sequences from mmCIF files.</li>
        <li>Identify and handle missing residues or atoms in protein structures.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>5. Data Visualization</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Explore different molecular representations such as cartoon, ball-and-stick, licorice, and surface models.</li>
        <li>Visualize molecular structures interactively using tools like `nglview`.</li>
        <li>Focus on specific parts of a molecule, such as ligands, water molecules, or protein chains.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>6. Atom and Residue Analysis</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Search for specific atoms and their coordinates within a structure.</li>
        <li>Find neighboring atoms within a specified distance.</li>
        <li>Analyze residues and their properties.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>7. Data Export and Image Rendering</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Save molecular visualizations as images for reports or presentations.</li>
        <li>Export processed data into structured formats like DataFrames.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>8. Bioinformatics Tools and Libraries</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Hands-on experience with Biopython, a powerful library for computational biology.</li>
        <li>Use Biopython's classes and methods for parsing and analyzing PDB and mmCIF files.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>9. Practical Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Work with real-world protein data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).</li>
        <li>Apply bioinformatics techniques to analyze and visualize protein structures.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>This notebook is ideal for learners who want to explore structural bioinformatics, molecular visualization, and data analysis using Python. It provides a step-by-step approach to understanding and working with protein structure data.</p>
